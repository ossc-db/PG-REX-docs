# PG-REX-docs
PG-REX is not software but documentation. It is designed to facilitate the construction, operation, and support of high-availability physical replication clusters for PostgreSQL based on Pacemaker, by providing procedures for setting up environments based on standardized software and hardware configurations, as well as scripts to simplify the management of the cluster. This repository only publishes the documentation part. We apologize, but due to certain circumstances, this documentation is available only in Japanese.
